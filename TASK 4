I have always had a fascination for Factory machines and HistoryTV18 show food-factory was where I first saw robotic arms.
Robotic arms are cool because they can do lots of different jobs, like building cars. What's interesting is how they're made to move like our arms, using special parts and computer programming. 
This project will help me dive into the world of robotics and allow me to know more about such fascinating machines.
