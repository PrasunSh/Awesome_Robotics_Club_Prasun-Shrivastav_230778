(View it in code form)
So, basically I have been able to only check whether the arm is reachable or not.
The logic behind till now was the least radius of sphere covered by the arm would be the when the arm is like
        ________
       |        |
       |        |
       |        |
       |
       |
       |
       |
And the longest radius would be when the robotic arm is completely straight.
I have considered that the angle is resticted between -90 to +90 from the previous arm.
